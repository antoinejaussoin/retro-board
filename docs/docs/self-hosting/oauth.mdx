# OAuth

On the public [Retrospected](https://www.retrospected.com) website, you will have noticed that people can register and login in one click using an OAuth provider:

You can provide the same seamless experience on your Self-Hosted instance by following the guide below.

:::tip Local Network
The following works even if you are self-hosting on a local or corporate network. Your instance doesn't have to
be reachable over the internet.

:::info What about other providers?
We will help you set up OAuth for **Google** and **Github**, but the process is similar for the other 
providers we support: **Okta**, **Microsoft**, **Twitter** and **Slack**.

## Github

If you are working in tech, chances are your users will have a GitHub account.

To setup OAuth for GitHub, follow the guide:

### Create the keys

- Go to your [GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile) (you need to be logged in)
- On the left-hand-side, find the `Developer settings` menu:<br />

- Select `OAuth Apps`<br />

- Fill the following information:
  - **Application name**: A name that you choose
  - **Home page URL**: the publicly reachable URL for your instance of Retrospected
  - **Description**: Some description of your choosing
  - **Authorization callback URL**: This is the most important: it is composed of the domain followed by `/api/auth/github/callback`.<br />

- Click `Register Application`
- Your app is now created, and you need to now click on `Generate a new client secret`. The page should now look like this:<br />

### Install the keys
- Copy both the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret` from the form above
- In your `docker-compose.yml` file, set them up respectively as `GITHUB_KEY` and `GITHUB_SECRET` in the backend section. [Look here](optionals) if you are not sure where these should be.
- Restart your containers (`docker-compose up -d`) and you should now be able to use GitHub to login ðŸŽ‰.
